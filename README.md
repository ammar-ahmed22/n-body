  <h1>n-body</h1>
  <p>Particle physics simulation with Rust and Bevy.</p>
</div>

## Current Plans
- Same size particles simulation
- Downwards gravity
- Elastic collisions with restitution
- Collisions with wall (window boundary)
- Spatial partioning with quadtree

## Future Plans
- n-body simulation with Barnes-Hut algorithm

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ammar-ahmed22/n-body
cd n-body
```

2. **Build and run the project**  
```bash
cargo run --release
```
